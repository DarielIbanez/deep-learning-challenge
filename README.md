# Deep-Learning-Challenge Report
In this analysis there were three layers total for each model after applying Neural Networks. The number of hidden nodes were dictated by the features. 477 parameters were createdby a three-layer training model. The first attempt was over 73% accuracy wich was under desired 75% but not too was off.
For the optimization, the second attempt with the "NAME" column in the dataset, achived an accuracy of almost 79%. This is 4% over the target 75% eith 3,298 parameters.
Multiple layers should be used for deep learning models since it learns how to predict abd classify information based on computer filtering inputs throught layers.
